xnu_build
=========

Build system for XNU compilation and GenericBooter compilation (Really not too pretty or useful.)

I plan to put up a full envoirment setup guide here, for OS X, Otherwise winocm's instructions are fairly straight forward.

Dependencies
============
	- mkimage
		brew install u-boot-tools
